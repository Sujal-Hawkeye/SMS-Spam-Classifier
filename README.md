# SMS-Spam-Classifier
To build an SMS spam classifier, you can follow these steps using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. I'll walk you through the process of creating a basic SMS spam classifier.

1. Problem Understanding :
The task is to classify a given SMS message as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). This is a binary classification problem.

2. Dataset :
You'll need a dataset that contains labeled SMS messages. A common dataset used is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset. It has two columns: the label (spam or ham) and the SMS message.

You can download this dataset from various sources, including Kaggle.

3. Steps to Build SMS Spam Classifier:
We'll use the following process:

Data Preprocessing:
Convert text to lowercase.
Tokenization (breaking text into individual words).
Removing stopwords and punctuation.
Stemming (reducing words to their base form).

Feature Extraction:
Convert text into numerical features using techniques like Bag of Words or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

Model Training:
Train a machine learning model using algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.
Model Evaluation:

Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance.
